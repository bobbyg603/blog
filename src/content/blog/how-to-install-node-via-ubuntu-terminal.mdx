## Introduction

This article provides the commands needed to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) on [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) via [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). Nvm (aka Node Version Manager) is a handy tool that makes it easy to download and switch between versions of Node.js.

## Steps

Make sure your system is up to date.

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

Install [curl](https://curl.se/) via `apt install`. Note it's important to install curl via `apt` instead of `snap`. For more info see this [Stack Overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67541374/nvm-getting-permission-denied-with-nvm-install-command).

```bash
sudo apt install curl
```

Download and run the [install script](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/master/install.sh) for `nvm`.

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/master/install.sh
bash install.sh
```

Verify that `nvm` was installed properly

```bash
nvm -v
# 0.39.2
```

Finally, install node via `nvm install`.

```bash
nvm install --lts
```

## Bonus

If your project depends on a specific version of node, create [.nvmrc](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#nvmrc) file in the project's root.

```bash
echo "18" > .nvmrc # default to version 18
```

You can switch to the version specified by a project with `nvm use`.

```bash
nvm use
# Found '/home/bobby/Desktop/github/node-dump-syms/.nvmrc' with version <18>
# Now using node v18.12.1 (npm v8.19.2)
```
