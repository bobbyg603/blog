Hey there! Welcome to my new personal blog. I'm Bobby Galli, and I'm excited to finally have a space to share my thoughts on software development, AI, and life in general.

## Why Start a Blog?

After years of writing technical articles for various publications, I realized I wanted a place that was truly my own. A place where I could share not just code, but also the stories behind the code — the late-night debugging sessions, the eureka moments, and yes, even the occasional rant about that one npm package that just won't work.

## What to Expect

Here's what you can look forward to:

### Tech & AI
I'll be sharing my experiences building software and exploring AI tools. Expect practical insights, lessons learned, and maybe a few war stories.

### AI Adventures
As someone who loves testing the latest AI tools, I'll document my experiments and share what actually works (and what doesn't).

### Life Beyond Code
Sometimes I'll step away from the keyboard to talk about hockey, golf, snowboarding, or life at the barn with my wife Cassie and her horse.

## The Tech Stack

This blog is built with [Astro](https://astro.build), a modern static site generator that lets me write content in Markdown while still having the power of components when I need them. The styling is done with Tailwind CSS, and the whole thing is designed to be fast, accessible, and easy to maintain.

No vendor lock-in here — just clean, simple code that I can host anywhere.

## Let's Connect

I'd love to hear from you! Whether you have questions, suggestions, or just want to say hi, feel free to reach out on [X](https://x.com/bobbyg603) — that's where I'm most active.

Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you find something useful here.

— Bobby
